Task 1
Here is a catalogue with 3 products.
Product Name : Price

Product C : $50

Discount Rules:
● "flat_10_discount": If cart total exceeds $200, apply a flat $10 discount on the cart total.
● "bulk_5_discount": If the quantity of any single product exceeds 10 units, apply a 5% discount
on that item's total price.
● "bulk_10_discount": If total quantity exceeds 20 units, apply a 10% 
discount on the cart total.
● "tiered_50_discount": If total quantity exceeds 30 units & any single product quantity greater
than 15, then apply a 50% discount on products which are above 15 quantity. The first 15
quantities have the original price and units above 15 will get a 50% discount.

calculates the discount amount for each rule and applies the most beneficial one for customer.
